# ds128 means Decimal 128 support

This module is designed to handle 128 unsigned arithmetical operations needed to decode
128-bit decimal numbers from text represenation.

Multiplication uses assembly and only AMD64 is supported now. ARM64 support will be implemented as soon as Apple will 
release their AXY for laptops.
